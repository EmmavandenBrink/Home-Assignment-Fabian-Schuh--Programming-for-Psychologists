### Description
My code analyzes functional brain imaging data (fMRI) to visualize brain activity during sleep (or any other activity) and explore functional coactivation patterns. It loads and processes neuroimaging files (.nii.gz), including anatomical and functional data, and displays relevant brain activity using statistical maps. My code also includes a histogram analysis of functional data to understand its value distribution.


### Table of Contents

1. _Data Files_: for initial visualizations utilized data files, downloaded from Neurosynth (https://neurosynth.org/locations/?x=0&y=0&z=0)

2. _Jupiter Notebook_: contains code with annotations used to perform visualizations

3. _Output Visualizations_: image files of visualizations, including (1) brain map, and (2) histogram.


### Python Packages used

1. _os_:          file handling & directory operations
2. _nibabel_:     reading neuroimaging data files
4. _matplotlib_:  plotting histogram
5. _nilearn_:     visualizing fMRI data
