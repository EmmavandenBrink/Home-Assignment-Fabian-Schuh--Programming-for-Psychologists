### Description
My code analyzes functional brain imaging data (fMRI) to visualize brain activity during sleep (or any other activity) and explore functional coactivation patterns. It loads and processes neuroimaging files (.nii.gz), including anatomical and functional data, and displays relevant brain activity using statistical maps. My code also includes a histogram analysis of functional data to understand its value distribution.
